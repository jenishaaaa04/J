                    <p>You care so deeply about the people you love, and it shows in everything you do. The way you check in, the way you remember the little things, the way you make sure everyone's okay - that's not something everyone does. You're genuinely loving, and I'm so lucky to experience that.</p>

                    <p>This is one of my favorite things about you, Megh. You think about others in ways that most people don't. The little gestures, the surprises, the way you remember things that matter - it all shows how thoughtful you are. It's these small things that make such a big difference.</p>
